# Automated-Treatment-System

## Summary

Automated Treatment System can be used to give primary treatment at rural health center where 24hrs treatment facilities are unavaiable.

## Background

People are not getting basic treatments for common health issues like fever, acidity, diarrhea, hypertension, common cold etc due to lack to treatment facilities.

Automatted system can suggest medicine based on patients condition. System to provide the following functionalities at treatment kiosk:
* Maintaining patient records
* Treatment history
* Suggest medicine based patient condition

## How to run:
The code is tested in python 3.7.8. 

Use command prompt and execute the following command:
<pre><code>python remote_automated_hospital.py</code></pre>


## Challenges

Getting real treatment history based on real symphoms from different hospital source and different geographical location. 

## What next?

Using treatment history and it's effectiveness, train ML model and use trained model to suggest medicine. 

Fully automated treament system can be designed as follows:
* Patient identified using biometric scan and fetch patient details from centralized system.
* Patient symphoms can be detected by camera
* Patient can enter symptoms manually
* Patient blood pressure, ECG, glucose level, fever and other vital parameters can be measure by automated system
* Finally, system will suggest medicine using pre-trained models.
